# Sé — pwnd

## Hi!

Once in a while we have something to say that we would rather not get lost in the facebook digital sea.  Something to share, but not just consumed like a popcorn at the movies.  A quick treat in endless succession.  It is pretentious I know.

So where do we put these thoughts?  

* Microsoft Office.  Such a terrible thing.  Sharing still does not really work.  The web version does not support all features, so you sometimes need to edit offline.  And now you are in locked documents and version control hell again.  Not like everyone can afford word anyways.  It's really a non-starter. ![dead tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Dead_tree%2C_Old_South_Road%2C_Breadalbane%2C_NSW.jpg)

* Google Docs.  Used to love them.  Until I tried to open a doc on my phone.  *Every* time I click on a linked resource, it asks if I want to install Chrome to follow the link, like a kid kicking the back of your seat. ![kicking seat](https://20843-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/kicking_seat.jpg)

* Medium.  Seems like a good idea.  Try making a page and extract the URL you made a link of?  I feel the alien parasitoid slipping down my throat... ![facehugger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Alien-The_Facehugger.png)

* Wordpress.  Ok, not bad.  Old school.  But what about some version control?  And I'm a coder.  I want my expression of thought to merge with my dev habits!

So here's what.  Github wiki.  There is version control.  No ads, links are links.  Here's to hope it doesn't get pwnd too...

## A call to digital arms

The anti-pwnd manifesto.

* As a dev, I pledge to resist siloing.
* Silos are good for monopolies, and bad for everyone else.
* If your best marketing plan is to hide your customer's keys so they can't leave your parking lot, you are just going to piss them off.
