The trends are there.  People use phones less and less for phone calls.  Maybe we are becoming more socially awkward; or maybe its rude assuming we can immediately take the full attention of someone whenever we choose.  Plus who the hell wants to transcribe the address you keep trying to repeat over the phone.  So your time is more important than their time? Well, both your time; since your both waiting around for something you could have typed in for the both of you.

But I digress.  The not news flash: phones are no fun anymore.  Just like snail mail turned into the “made you look!” prank in middle school + the bill box, the phone is just a shit box because it is a better version of the “made you look!” prank + occasional calls you actually really care about.

So I block about 4 numbers a day.  Humans with really important jobs can’t do this (like doctors), so this whole robocall industry is literally killing us with a denial of service attack.

But I digress.  But less so.  Think about millions of phones that pepper “blacklist” thinly over the phone number rolling seascape.  Individually, there is little harm in the idea of a phone.  But now think about someone who wants a company and thinks; companies need phones.  Any new number is in some customer’s blacklist.  They can’t use the phone to reliably contact their customer base.

They can’t reliably use a phone, and they have become supremely annoying.  So the company has to accommodate things their customers actually enjoys using.  

Phone companies should take this much more seriously.  Social media has already captured your actual interest; your phone number is the only reason you can’t easily drift between what is otherwise your mobile internet service provider.

Last digression.  You used to go to the mail to see if you got a letter from your grandmother.  You used to answer the door to talk to your neighbor about their lost dog.  You used to answer the phone to make weekend plans with your friends.  The “made you look” prank has jaded our ability to make and keep social connections. I care far more about this than my phone number.
